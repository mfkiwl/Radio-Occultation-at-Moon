# Radio-Occultation-at-Moon
The project estimates the possible number of radio occultation between 2 satellites orbiting the Moon. 
The program contains Radio Occultation, Minimum Altitude and Plotting 3 parts.  
The program will import the coordinate of 2 satellites, 
calculate the shortest distance between the line and center of moon, 
determine if occultation occurs. 
After that the program will pick the lowest altitude and mark the point on the moon map as 1 radio occultation occurances.
For those who want the coordinate of 2 satellites, please email to tgvesteban@gmail.com.
